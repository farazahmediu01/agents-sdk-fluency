# check a `**kwargs` call against it -- and calling by name is the entire point
# of a registry a model dispatches into. `...` means "any signature", which
# honestly reflects what a registry of differently-shaped tools is.
#
# You are giving up argument checking at this line. Chapter 2 buys it back, at
# the boundary, with Pydantic -- which is a better place for it anyway, because
# by then the arguments are arriving from a language model rather than from you.
