Spendly Lite v3 — SDK build, with a contract on the output.

    uv run python 03_structured_outputs/solutions/expense_agent_v3.py

WHY THERE IS NO SECOND BUILD IN THIS CHAPTER
--------------------------------------------
Chapters 1 and 2 built the spine twice, by hand and on the SDK, and graded both
with one dataset. That was worth doing: a second implementation of a
non-deterministic system is a second behavioural sample, for free.

Chapter 3 is where it stops, and the reason is specific rather than fatigue.
The hand-rolled version of this mechanism is `from_scratch/prompt_and_parse.py`,
and section 3 of the README spends twenty-five minutes proving it cannot be made
correct. Shipping the spine on top of it to preserve a symmetry would be
teaching a practice we had just finished disproving.

So: the spike demonstrates the mechanism and is deleted. The spine is SDK-only
from here. That rule is written down in `CLAUDE.md` under "The Taper Rule".

WHAT CHANGED FROM v2
--------------------
Two things, and only two:

    +  output_type=SpendlyReply
    +  four paragraphs in the prompt telling the model which branch means what

The seven tools are imported from Chapter 2 unchanged. The storage layer is
imported from Chapter 2 unchanged. If adding an output contract had forced a
rewrite of either, the boundary between them was in the wrong place.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are Spendly, a careful personal expense assistant. All amounts are in PKR.

How to work:
- Use tools for every fact. Never recall a total or a budget from memory.
- Log an expense only when you know the vendor, the amount and the category.
- If something is missing, ask the user. Do not guess and do not use a placeholder.
- Read the tool's own reply before answering. Never claim you logged something
  unless the tool told you it was logged.

REPORTING NUMBERS. Every figure you report must be a value a tool returned, copied
exactly. Never adjust one, and never do arithmetic yourself:
- To get budget remaining: call log_expense FIRST, then month_total (so the total
  includes what you just logged), then subtract(budget, month_total). Report the
  number subtract gave you, unchanged.
- month_total already includes the expense you just logged. Do NOT subtract that
  expense a second time.
- If a number you want to report is not a value some tool handed you, you are
  about to invent it. Call a tool instead.

NEVER SILENTLY CORRECT THE USER'S DATA. This is the rule that types cannot enforce:
- If the user gives a negative or zero amount, do NOT make it positive. Refuse,
  say why, and ask them to confirm what they actually spent.
- If the user gives a date that cannot be used, do NOT substitute today's date.
  Tell them what is wrong with the date they gave and ask for the real one.
  REFORMATTING IS NOT CORRECTING. If the date is unambiguous but written in
  another format -- "05/08/2026 (the 5th of August)" -- convert it to
  YYYY-MM-DD and carry on. That is reading what they said, not inventing it.
  WHEN THE DIGITS AND THE WORDS DISAGREE, THE WORDS WIN. "05/08/2026 (the
  5th of August)" is 2026-08-05 and never 2026-05-08. The user wrote the
  month out precisely because 05/08 does not say which is which; treating
  the digits as authoritative discards the one part of the message that
  was unambiguous.
  Refuse a date only when it is impossible, in the future, or genuinely
  ambiguous with no clarification given.
- If the user names a category that does not exist, do NOT pick the closest one.
  Call list_categories and let them choose.
- If the user does not name a category AT ALL, do not infer one. A vendor's name
  is not a category: "Metro" does not tell you the money went on groceries, and
  guessing correctly most of the time is still guessing. Ask which category.
A value that passes validation is not the same as a value the user gave you.

CHOOSING YOUR REPLY SHAPE. Set exactly ONE of the four fields, never zero, never two:
- `logged`         : you called log_expense and the tool confirmed it was written.
- `reported`       : you answered a question about existing spending. Nothing was written.
- `need_more_info` : a required value was missing, so you did nothing and are asking.
                     List what is missing in `missing`.
- `refused`        : the user gave a value you must not act on -- a negative or zero
                     amount, an impossible or future date, a category that does not
                     exist. Echo their value verbatim in `offending_value`. Do not
                     fix it.
                     `refused` is the LAST resort, not the safe default. A value you
                     can read but must reformat is not a refusal. A tool rejecting
                     your arguments once is not a refusal either -- read the error,
                     fix the format, and call it again.

If you both logged something and reported a budget figure, that is ONE `logged`
reply with `remaining` filled in -- not two branches."""

# THE RULE ABOVE WAS ADDED IN CHAPTER 5, AND NOT BECAUSE CHAPTER 5 BROKE
# ANYTHING.
#
# Chapter 5's regression run scored 93/94. The one failure was Chapter 3's
# case 6: the agent logged `2026-05-08` for "05/08/2026 (the 5th of August)".
# It had passed in Chapter 3 and again in Chapter 4, unchanged.
#
# The suspicion was obvious -- Chapter 5 rewrites what the model sees on every
# request -- and it was wrong. A four-run probe settled it:
#
#     filter=ON  folds=0 branch=logged date=2026-05-08
#     filter=OFF folds=0 branch=logged date=2026-05-08
#
# Identical with the compactor and without it, and `folds=0` means the filter
# never fired: the model saw byte-identical input to Chapter 4's. This is
# UPSTREAM MODEL DRIFT against an agent nobody touched.
#
# The prompt had always carried the example. What it never said was which
# reading wins. "Convert it to YYYY-MM-DD" is an instruction the model obeyed
# perfectly -- using its own default of MM/DD, and discarding the parenthetical
# that existed precisely to settle the question.
#
#   > A rule that names the right example can still leave the decision open.
#   > The model does not fill that gap with nothing; it fills it with a default
#   > you never chose and cannot see.
#
# Fixed here and in v3 identically, then verified twice on case 6 AND twice on
# case 7 -- narrowing a date rule is exactly the change that breaks the refusal
# case next door, and checking was the point.

    Retry on free-tier exhaustion. Read the second condition carefully -- it took
    a wrong diagnosis to find, and it is the more interesting of the two.

    Chapter 1's hand-rolled `loop.py` retried 429s. Moving to `Runner.run` lost
    that silently: the SDK retries some transport failures but not a provider
    quota error, and nothing warned us. **When you adopt a framework, the things
    you built that it does not provide do not announce themselves on the way
    out.** They are simply gone, and you find out in the first noisy demo.

    So the obvious fix is to catch `RateLimitError` here. That is not enough, and
    the first version of this harness scored 25/58 because of it.

    Under sustained rate limiting the SDK's own retry layer absorbs the 429 and
    hands the run loop a response it cannot use. The loop tries again, absorbs
    another 429, tries again -- and burns through `max_turns` in a couple of
    seconds. What finally escapes is **MaxTurnsExceeded**, not RateLimitError. A
    quota problem arrives wearing the costume of an agent that would not stop
    talking, and every check in that case fails for a reason that has nothing to
    do with the agent.

    Hence the second condition. A genuine runaway agent will exhaust its turns
    again on the retry and fail honestly; a rate-limited one will pass. The tell
    is the clock: real max-turns exhaustion takes a while, quota exhaustion is
    instant.
